# 👋 Hi there! I'm Bibash Tandon

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer focused on **blockchain development**, **smart contract security**, and backend engineering with **Python & FastAPI**. I enjoy building decentralized applications, finding and fixing security issues in smart contracts, and designing reliable, well-tested APIs. I work across the stack — from writing secure Solidity and performing audits to building production-ready REST backends with modern Python tooling.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

### Blockchain / Smart Contracts
- Solidity, EVM tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle, Remix)
- Smart contract security & auditing (Slither, MythX, manual review)
- Web3 libraries: Ethers.js, web3.js
- IPFS / decentralized storage concepts

### Backend / Python / APIs
- Python 3.13 · FastAPI · Uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy (ORM) · Alembic (migrations)
- Pydantic / pydantic-settings
- PostgreSQL
- Docker · docker-compose
- Testing with pytest

### General / DevOps
- Git, CI/CD pipelines, containerization
- Familiarity with C++, Java, JavaScript


## 📂 Notable Projects

### 🔒 [Web3 Security Auditing Projects](https://github.com/BBashh/Web3)
- **Description:** Conducted public competitive audits of smart contracts, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and improving security.
- **Technologies Used:** Solidity, Foundry, Manual Review
- **Highlights:** Worked with Codehawks, Sherlock Defi, Cantina and Code4rena; contributed to securing several high-profile DeFi projects.


### 🧭 [FastAPI Backend (Social-media style)](https://github.com/BBashh/fastapi-backend)
- **Description:** A modular FastAPI REST backend implementing core features for a social-media-like app (users, posts, authentication, votes). Built with production-ready patterns: SQLAlchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, Pydantic settings for configuration, and PostgreSQL for persistence.
- **Tech Stack:** Python 3.13 · FastAPI · Uvicorn · SQLAlchemy · PostgreSQL · Alembic · Pydantic · Docker / docker-compose
- **Highlights:** Demonstrates backend engineering skills — API design, DB modeling, migrations, and containerized deployment. 

### 💰 [DeFi Stable Coin](https://github.com/BBashh/Foundry-StableCoin)
- **Description:** Built a DeFi stable coin with mechanisms for stability and liquidity on the Ethereum network.
- **Technologies Used:** Solidity, Foundry, Manual Review, Static Analysis
- **Highlights:** Designed and deployed a decentralized stablecoin protocol with robust security measures.

### 🎟️ [Decentralized Raffle](https://github.com/BBashh/Foundry-Raffle)
- **Description:** Developed a decentralized raffle application leveraging Ethereum smart contracts for transparent and fair ticketing.
- **Technologies Used:** Solidity, Truffle, Ethers.js
- **Highlights:** Implemented secure random number generation and ticket management using Chainlink.
